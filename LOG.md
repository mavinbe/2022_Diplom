### Do 04. Feb

#### Objects
1. decide how video playback is made,
    a. images are shown after the camera position is calculated by the pipeline
    b. images are shown as they arrise, and position is delayed
    c. or implemenmt both possibilities

2. decide which concurrency model to use
    https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/

3. create an app that reads video and display it

4. build a prototype of "image -> box detection -> pose estimation -> camera position -> image" pipeline


#### Ideas
- implement playback with gstreamer, it a little work but maybe we can use it @see 2021_Diplom/2021_Diplom_Lab/google-coral/examples-camera/gstreamer/detect.py


#### Done
1. I choose a. for now, its good enough for now, later I can implemenmt it other wise
2. is obsolet cause of 1.

canceled at 13:30 cause M is not sleeping, so I go support P
