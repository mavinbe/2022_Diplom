This is a daily log, where aims and ideas for a day are formulated and reviewed.

## Backlog
- smoother pose results with kalman filter( ask arkadi)

## Logs

### 05 -- Di 15. Feb

#### Objects
1. create an app that reads video and display it
2. show pose detections on vi
3. apply kalman filter to smooth


opt
4. run detection and store result
5. run pose and store result

#### DONE
1. Done
2. Done
3. created prototype in lab/2d/py

#### Reflection 
was a good day, i accomplished a good batch of stuff
i'm looking forward for tomorrow to finish kalman smoothining and intigrate it into my code

### 04 -- Mo 14. Feb

#### Objects
1. create an app that reads video and display it

opt
2. run detection and store result
3. run pose and store result

#### DONE

1. took Yolo5 and just inserted movenet, for fast prototyping

### 03 -- Fr 11. Feb

#### Objects
1. Make a timetable till end of next week
2. define interfaces of app parts

opt
3. create an app that reads video and display it

#### DONE
nothing finished, was not focused and later interrupted by familie

### 02 -- Do 04. Feb

#### Objects
1. decide how video playback is made,
    a. images are shown after the camera position is calculated by the pipeline
    b. images are shown as they arrise, and position is delayed
    c. or implemenmt both possibilities

2. decide which concurrency model to use
    https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/

3. create an app that reads video and display it

4. build a prototype of "image -> box detection -> pose estimation -> camera position -> image" pipeline


#### Ideas
- implement playback with gstreamer, it a little work but maybe we can use it @see 2021_Diplom/2021_Diplom_Lab/google-coral/examples-camera/gstreamer/detect.py


#### Done
1. I choose a. for now, its good enough for now, later I can implemenmt it other wise
2. is obsolet cause of 1.

canceled at 13:30 cause M is not sleeping, so I go support P

#### Review 11.02.2022
3. defer 
4. defer 
cause its

### 01 -- Di 02. Feb / Mi 03. Feb

#### Objects
make basic technic run, pose detection, box detection

#### Done 
all

#### Review 
the objects where backdated formualted, so it's not a real review, but anyway we have a good state
